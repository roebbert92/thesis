frameworks is just a storage directory for code of T5-ASP.

## Reproduce results

Reproducing the results for T5-ASP, just run run.py in the respective experiment folder.
To reproduce results for FLAIR, run models > flair_roberta.py.
To reproduce results for DictMatch, run models > dict_match.py.
To reproduce results for SearchMatch, run models > search_match.py.

## Evaluate results

Run the respective Juypter notebooks after running the experiments.
